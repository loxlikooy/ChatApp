This project is a Chat application created as a final project for easier communication among AITU students. This application allows users to register, create a profile, and message other users on the platform.

The application implements a free user policy, allowing users to see every registered user on the platform and their UID in their profile page. The application was written using Firebase and Android Kotlin documentation, along with some Stack Overflow references.

## How to use the application
To use the Chat application, you will need to follow these steps:

Register on the platform by providing your basic information.
Once registered, log in to your account.
Browse through the user list to find someone you want to message.
Click on the user's profile to view their UID.
Click on the 'DM' button to send them a direct message.
Type your message in the text box and click on the 'Send' button.
The user will receive your message, and you can continue chatting with them.
